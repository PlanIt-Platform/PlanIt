# PlanIt

> This document contains the documentation for the PlanIt project.

PlanIt is a multi-platform application designed to solve the common problem faced by groups when scheduling events. With comprehensive features, PlanIt offers users a centralized platform to plan, organize, and participate in events efficiently and conveniently.

## Context

Organizing group events is often a complex and challenging task. Through PlanIt, we aim to provide users with various tools to ease the process. By centralizing event organization on a single platform, PlanIt eliminates the need for scattered tools and significantly reduces the time and effort expended by organizers.

## Features

- **Categories**: Various categories for different events allowing users to filter events according to their preferences.
- **Event Creation**: Allows users to create custom events, defining dates, times, locations, and other relevant information, whether they are public or private, with the option of private invitations via code.
- **Participant View**: Within events, participants and their attendance confirmation statuses are visible, tasks are assigned, and responsible parties are selected.
- **Communication Channel (Chat)**: Provides a dedicated communication channel for each event, facilitating the exchange of information among participants.
- **Polls**: Users can create polls to reach consensus on opinions that require group decisions.
- **Event Discovery**: Allows users to discover public events of interest through a search tab, increasing accessibility and diversity of event options.
- **Evaluation and Feedback**: A section where users can leave their evaluation and feedback regarding the platform, aimed at identifying possible improvements and measuring user satisfaction.
- **Personal Calendar**: Provides users with a personal calendar to record events, facilitating their organization and access to availability.

## Technologies

PlanIt will be developed using the following technologies:

- **Kotlin**: As the primary language for development.
- **SpringMVC**: For the API (server-side).
- **React with TypeScript**: For the web application.
- **PostgreSQL**: As the database.
- **Kotlin for Android**: For the Android application.
